 <h3>Synopsis</h3>

 <p> Sonia Sotomayor was born on June 25, 1954, in the
  Bronx borough of New York City. Her desire to be a judge was first inspired by
  the TV show Perry Mason. She graduated from Yale Law School and passed the bar
  in 1980. She became a U.S. District Court Judge in 1992 and was elevated to
  the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1998. In 2009, she became the
  first Latina Supreme Court Justice in U.S. history.</p>
  
  <h3>First Latina Supreme Court Justice </h3>
  
 <p> On May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama announced his nomination of
  Sotomayor for Supreme Court Justice. The nomination was confirmed by the U.S.
  Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68 to 31, making Sotomayor the first Latina
  Supreme Court Justice in U.S. history.</p>
  
  <p>In June 2015, Sotomayor made history
  again (twice) when she was among the majority in two landmark Supreme Court
  rulings. On June 25, she was one of the six justices to uphold a critical
  component of the 2010 Affordable Care Act-often referred to as Obamacare-in
  King v. Burwell. The decision allows the federal government to continue
  providing subsidies to Americans who purchase health care through "exchanges,"
  regardless of whether they are state or federally operated. Sotomayor is
  credited as a key force in the ruling, having presented cautionary arguments
  against the potential dismantling of the law. The majority ruling, written by
  Chief Justice John Roberts, thus further cemented the Affordable Care Act.
  Conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia were in
  dissent, with Scalia presenting a scathing dissenting opinion to the Court.</p>
  
  <p>On June 26, the Supreme Court handed down its second historic decision in as many
  days, with a 5-4 majority ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that made same sex
  marriage legal in all 50 states. Sotomayor joined Justices Ruth Bader
  Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan in the majority,
  with Roberts, Alito, Scalia and Thomas dissenting.</p>
